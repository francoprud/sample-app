# Ruby On Rails Tutorial: Sample App

This is the sample application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

Some modifications where made to this tutorial, like using the testing framework [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) instead of Test::Unit, or the use of [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) Ruby static code analyzer..
